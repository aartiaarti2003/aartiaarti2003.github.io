                <p>During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.[5]
                     Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.[6]
                      In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.[6]
                       The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.[5]

                    To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany.[6]
                     The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;[6]
                      some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance.[7] While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.
                    
                    With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.[6]
                     At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise.[6] Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working.[6] 
                     He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.[6]
