        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         Hi, I'm Aarti, a very intersted person in  web developing currently pursuing my studies 
          at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. My journey in the coding world started during my 
          senior secondary school days, driven by a curiosity to transform 
          creative ideas into digital realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a girl passionate about technology, I find joy in overcoming coding 
          challenges and building visually appealing and functional websites. 
          Alongside my studies, I actively contribute to fostering a supportive 
          community for women in tech and promoting diversity in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the world of coding, I love playing sports. Whether it's hitting
          the field, court, or track, sports bring a perfect balance to my life, 
          keeping me active and energized.
        </p>
