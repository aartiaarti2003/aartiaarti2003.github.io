                Description: The <p> tag is used to define paragraphs in HTML. It is a block-level element that represents a distinct block of text.
                <a> (Anchor):
                
                Description: The <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks in HTML. It allows you to link to other web pages, files, or locations within the same page.
                     It is commonly used with the href attribute to specify the target URL.
                <img> (Image):
                
                Description: The <img> tag is used to embed images in HTML documents. It is a self-closing tag and requires the src attribute to specify the source (URL or file path) of the image.
                 The alt attribute is also recommended for providing alternative text for accessibility.
                <ul> (Unordered List):
                
                Description: The <ul> tag is used to create unordered lists in HTML. It is a block-level element that typically contains <li> (list item) elements.
                     Each <li> element represents a list item, and the list items are usually displayed with bullet points.
                <div> (Division):
                
                Description: The <div> tag is a generic container element in HTML that is used to group and structure content. It is a block-level element and is often used with CSS for styling purposes or to apply JavaScript functionality. 
                    The <div> tag itself does not have any specific visual representation.
